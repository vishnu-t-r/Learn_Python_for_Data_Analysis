Use the user input method of Python to take the values.\n\nThe function should be able to do the division for you and give you the result. But here's the catch: if you try to divide by zero (which is not allowed in math), the function should be smart enough to catch that and tell you that it's not possible to divide by zero. Instead of showing an error, it should return None, which means 'nothing' or 'no value', and print `\"Error: Cannot divide by Zero.`\n",
